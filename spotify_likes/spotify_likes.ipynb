    "This analysis is of a dataset that comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/geomack/spotifyclassification) and represents a list of songs and their attributes that a user liked or didn't like. Information about the Spotify API that the dataset was pulled from and the data variables themselves can be found here: [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-audio-features/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will aim to predict if the user likes or doesn't like a song. To predict what songs a user likes algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees and random forests, kNN, and potentially SVM if the data can be separated linearly. A bonus, if time permits, would be to clustering the songs by artist or genre (if a linking dataset can be found).\n",
